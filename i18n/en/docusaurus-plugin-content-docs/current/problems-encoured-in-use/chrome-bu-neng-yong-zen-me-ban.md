# Chrome cannot be used

Chrome can definitely be used normally. If it is found that the Chrome browser is not available, other browsers can be used. Follow the steps below to troubleshoot:

1. Check whether everything is normal in the incognito state? Canâ€™t Google Google only in normal mode? If this is the case, check whether there are conflicting plug-ins installed (Google Assistant, Youku Unlocking, Chinese Returning to China, Exam Monitoring and other similar plug-ins), and disable them first because they have taken over the proxy module of the Chrome browser.
2. Reinstall Chrome on regular channels. Using other browsers, download the Chrome browser from the Google Chrome official website, and click [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/) to go directly to the Chrome official website.
