### Why is this configuration necessary?

**Answer: **By default, when using our software to surf the Internet, in order to save your usage data, the URL you visit will be roughly distinguished. When the software recognizes that you are visiting a mainland website, it will not use us For node traffic, use your China-mainland IP to surf the Internet; when visiting overseas websites, using our node to forward data is to use overseas IP to surf the Internet. Since bilibili is mainly a China-mainland video station, our software will give priority to the assumption that what you want to watch is station B in the mainland area, so the IP on the mainland will be used first. If you want to go to station B in Hong Kong and Taiwan, Need to use global mode to force all Internet operations to use overseas IP.
