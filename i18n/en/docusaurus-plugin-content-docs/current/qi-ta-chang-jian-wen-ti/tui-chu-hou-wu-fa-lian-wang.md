# Can't connect to the Internet after logging out?

## reason

When connecting to the node, the small plane will automatically configure the browser on your system, so that the traffic to the external network will be forwarded through the small plane program. If you do not manually launch the small airplane program before the computer is restarted or shut down, the small airplane will exit abnormally and the browser settings will not be restored.

## Solution

three methods:

1. After turning on the small plane again, set the mode to "Direct connection", and then exit.
2. Open the browser settings-proxy settings-choose not to use a proxy
3. Open the control panel-network-proxy-choose not to use proxy
