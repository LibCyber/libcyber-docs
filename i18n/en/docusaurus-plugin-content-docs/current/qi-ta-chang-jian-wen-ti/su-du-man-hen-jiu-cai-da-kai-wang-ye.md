# The speed is slow, it takes a long time to open the webpage



Try to use **Global Mode**, and then open **Incognito Browsing** to see if it still freezes. If there is no problem in Incognito mode, it means that your **Browser Plug-in Conflict** is slow. Check whether there are conflicting plug-ins (Google Assistant, Youku Unlock, Chinese Returning to China, Exam Monitoring, etc.), uninstall or disable them. If you still have problems, uninstall all plug-ins and purchase exclusive dedicated line nodes **#manual funny**


:::caution
Please consciously do not crowd on nodes 1 and 2 in each area, otherwise it may cause obvious congestion.
