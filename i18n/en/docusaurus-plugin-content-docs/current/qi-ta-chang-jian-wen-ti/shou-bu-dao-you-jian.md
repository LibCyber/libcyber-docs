# Cannot receive mail

When registering an account and resetting your password, you need to use your mailbox to receive emails.

The mail delivery time is generally 1-3s, and no more than 30 minutes at most. If you do not receive the verification email, please check the trash box first, or change your overseas mailbox.

If you try more than one email address and still cannot receive the email after more than 30 minutes, please contact the customer service staff to provide the verification code, or perform manual registration.
